FAQs:

    answer: >
      Contrary to somewhat popular belief, pressure washing is not harmful to your home when done correctly with the appropriate pressure settings.
      In fact, it is a recommended method for maintaining a clean and well-maintained exterior surface.
      However, pressure washing requires expertise to avoid potential issues or damage.
      For guaranteed great results, it"s essential to hire a qualified and experienced company like Dirt and Grime, Co.

  - question: "How often should I get my house washed?"

He was out at our house the following morning and had the job finished in about 2.5 hours. Our driveway, front steps, and entry way look COMPLETELY different. It’s honestly incredible! We will 100% be hiring Dirt & Grime Co again to take care of our driveway/front area. Cannot recommend enough!"
